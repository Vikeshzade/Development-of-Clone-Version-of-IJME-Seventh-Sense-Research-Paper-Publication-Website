                            All manuscripts are subject to peer review and are expected to meet standards of academic
                            excellence. If approved by the editor, submissions will be considered by peer-reviewers,
                            whose identities will remain anonymous to the authors. Our Research Integrity team will
                            occasionally seek advice outside standard peer review, for example, on submissions with
                            serious ethical, security, biosecurity, or societal implications. We may consult experts and
                            the academic editor before deciding on appropriate actions, including but not limited to:
                            recruiting reviewers with specific expertise, assessment by additional editors, and
                            declining to further consider a submission.

                            All journals published by SSRG are committed to publishing only original material, i.e.,
                            material that has neither been published elsewhere, nor is under review elsewhere. SSRG uses
                            the
                            software to detect instances of overlapping and similar text in submitted manuscripts.

                            are found to have been plagiarized from a manuscript by other authors, whether published or

                            Conflicts of interest (COIs, also known as ‘competing interests’) occur when issues outside
                            research could be reasonably perceived to affect the neutrality or objectivity of the work
                            or its assessment. Potential conflicts of interest must be declared – whether or not they
                            actually had an influence – to allow informed decisions. In most cases, this declaration
                            will not stop work from being published nor will it always prevent someone from being
                            involved in a review process.

                        </p>
                        <p>If unsure, declare a potential interest or discuss with the editorial office. Undeclared
                            interests may incur sanctions. Submissions with undeclared conflicts that are later revealed
                            may be rejected. Published articles may need to be re-assessed, have a corrigendum
                            published, or in serious cases be retracted.</p>

                            It is important that the authors record the results of their research in a form that its
                            analysis and review could be done before the publication and by other researchers for a
                            reasonable period after publication. Fabrication, like reporting results that were never
                            conducted or deceive or intent to mislead, is a form of scientific misconduct and regarded
                            as highly unethical and in some jurisdictions may be illegal. </p>

                            The authors should submit their research papers in the journal's precise format for each
                            publication. The information provided by the authors should be concise, authentic and give
                            details of the research experiments performed. Authors should include recent research
                            articles and bring in comparative analysis to support their research. However, in doing so
                            authors should rewrite the information in their own words and represent it in a form that
                            supports their original work of research. This information, used from the work of
                            competitors, other researchers and partners, should be citied as references in the research
                            papers. They should also cite publications that have been influential in determining the
                            nature of the reported work.

                            Authorship credit should be based on substantial contributions to conception and design, or
                            acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; drafting the article or
                            revising it critically for important intellectual content; and final approval of the version
                            to be published. A citied author should meet all of these criteria. Individuals that made
                            other contributions to the research like obtaining funds for the research, collecting
                            important data and materials, or co-ordinating with the publication, are significant but do
                            not qualify for authorship. These individuals can be acknowledged in the research papers.
                        </p>
                        <p>The source of funding for the research project or the publication of the document should be
                            stated. The author should clearly declare that the submitted work and its essential
                            substance have not previously been published and are not being considered for publication
                            elsewhere. If a primary research report has been published, the author should clearly state
                            it and also mention the advancement and new analyses or syntheses of data in the secondary
                            research report. An overlap of about 10 per cent is considered acceptable between such
                            journals.

                        </p>
                        <p>Plagiarism is an unethical practice in the field of research and is completely unacceptable.
                            Authors are required to state they are the copyright owners or they have taken the copyright
                            owners' permission before submitting the research report. Any breach of copyright is not
                            acceptable. Besides journals, SSRG also publishes Conference Proceedings for a no fee. These
                            are intended to serve the community as a means of sharing the most recent work-in-progress
                            in respective areas of research. Conference organizers have to declare that the proceedings
                            will not be shared with or published in any other journal.

                            The editor of a journal has a complete authority and responsibility to accept or reject a
                            submitted paper and is not influenced by the management or owners in any form. The editor
                            may confer with associate editor, co-editors and peer-reviewers while making a decision. The
                            editors should judge all submissions on their scientific merit and minimize the influence of
                            other factors. The decision should be timely and fair irrespective of caste, culture,
                            origin, gender or citizenship of the author. Editors, authors, and peer reviewers have a
                            responsibility to disclose interests that might appear to affect their ability to present or
                            review data objectively. These include relevant financial, personal, political,
                            intellectual, or religious interests. Editors and board members should, whenever these are
                            relevant to the content being considered or published, declare their interests and
                            affiliations. The editorial team should not disclose any information about a submitted paper
                            under consideration other than to reviewers. Situations that may lead to conflicts of
                            interest should be avoided. </p>
